# Bug Prevention Checklist Results

## JavaScript Live Editor Implementation - Initial Creation

**Date**: $(date)
**Components Reviewed**: App.tsx, JavaScriptEditor.tsx, LiveCanvas.tsx, code-store.ts

### Checklist Results:

1. **✓ Immutability**: 
   - Using Zustand with immer middleware for immutable state updates
   - All state modifications go through proper actions
   - No direct state mutations

2. **✓ Input validation**: 
   - Code execution is sandboxed with limited global access
   - Dangerous functions (setInterval, window access) are blocked
   - Error boundaries catch and display execution errors safely

3. **✓ Async guards**: 
   - Simple state management prevents race conditions
   - setTimeout has proper limits and cleanup
   - No complex async operations that could cause issues

4. **✓ Dead code**: 
   - No unused exports or functions
   - All imports are utilized
   - Clean, focused component implementations

5. **✓ Error handling**: 
   - Canvas component has proper error boundaries
   - Store includes error state management
   - User-friendly error display with accessibility support

6. **✓ Prefer CSS**: 
   - All styling implemented via CSS modules
   - No inline styles or CSS-in-JS
   - Responsive design handled in CSS

7. **✓ Cleanup**: 
   - Canvas effects properly clean up on unmount
   - Event listeners are removed in useEffect cleanup
   - No memory leaks identified

8. **✓ State initialization**: 
   - Proper initial states with sensible defaults
   - Default code provides good user experience
   - Error states handled gracefully
   - LocalStorage persistence with error handling

### Security Considerations:
- Code execution is sandboxed to prevent malicious code
- Limited global access prevents dangerous operations
- Canvas-only drawing context provided safely

### Accessibility Considerations:
- Proper ARIA labels on all interactive elements
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader friendly error messages
- Focus management implemented

### Performance Considerations:
- React.memo used for expensive components
- Proper dependency arrays in useEffect
- Efficient re-rendering patterns

**Status**: ✅ All checklist items passed
**Action Required**: None - implementation follows best practices
